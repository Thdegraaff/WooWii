title: Typesetting
---

In this 2h. session we introduce the concept of markup languages in combination with pandoc and working with the terminal. In particular we focus on markdown: a very lightweight and markup language (and probably the fastest way to create slides). In particular we deal with:

1. `LaTeX`
2. `Markdown`
3. `Pandoc`

Although the last one, pandoc, is not completely necessary (it is under the hood of `RStudio`), we think it is important and handy enough to spend some on.
