# Call for Workshop On Open Workflow II


## What

### *Overview*

We organise a two-day open workflows for quantitative social scientists. Despite its recognized relevance, relative complexity and wide interest from both inside and outside academia, virtually no training is provided to students and researchers in the social sciences about workflow design and choice of appropriate tools. This entails that the conceptual arguments to adopt open science practices when *doing* research, as well as an overview of specific tools that embody such principles and enhance their adoption are absent from the researcher's mind when the decision to adopt a certain workflow is made. This workshop contributes to fill the gap in both respects by covering the main ideas behind a well-designed workflow with openness, transparency and reproducibility in mind, *and* by providing an introductory, hands-on, overview of specific freely available tools.

### *Contents*

The structure of the workshop is organized in two main blocks. Firstly, we present basic concepts such as Open Science, transparency and reproducibility. We then stress the relevance of paying attention to the way science is carried out and connects it to the choice of tools that allow such values to be seamlessly embraced in the day-to-day practice of quantitative research in social science. These somewhat abstract ideas are made operative through the concept of workflow, as the vehicle to embody these principles in daily practice.

The second, longer, part of the workshop includes a hands-on overview of specific tools that have been designed with Open Science principles in mind and that hence provide the ingredients of a well-thought open workflow. This is delivered alternating presentation time with demo time, allowing participants to get a real taste of what using the tools implies and see live their advantages. In this respect, they are **very much** advised to bring their laptops to follow along on their own. 

Throughout the second section, the emphasis is not set on getting to every single detail of each tool and package, but to give a gentle introduction, to provide further material and to place them in the appropriate context. Important emphasis will be put on how they contribute to building an open workflow and how they relate to the rest of the tools in the workflow. The main areas to be reviewed are:

* Mark-up languages such as Markdown.
* The LaTeX typesetting system.
* Reference managers, particularly those open and free such as Bibtex, compatible with LaTeX.
* Conversion tools such as pandoc.
* Open environments for statistical computing such as R or Python.
* Version control systems such as git (although commercial alternatives like Dropbox will be highlighted as well).
* Back-up solutions.

### *Output*

In the end, participants will be able to rewrite a paper of their own in an open, transparent and reproducible way, as well as learn how to make it freely accessible on the web. This process implies two main components: on the one hand, automating both the typesetting process (including bibliography and presentation of results) and the quantitative analysis (such as data reading and handling); and, on the other hand, the publication of their material (such as the text, code and data) in such a way that it is freely accessible, provided that there is no privacy or confidentiality issues associated with the data.

## How

### *Materials*

This website as well as all the material included and used at the workshop are hosted as an open GitHub repository at [this url](https://github.com/darribas/WooWii). This means you can clone it and access not only the entire website and materials but also the revision history tracked using git. Again, participants are **very much** advised to bring their own laptop.

### *Who*

The workshop was inspired by a previous edition ([WooW](http://darribas.org/WooW)) and conceived by [Dani Arribas-Bel](http://darribas.org) from the University of Birmingham in the UK and [Thomas De Graaff](http://www.thomasdegraaff.net/) from the VU University Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

### *When and where*  

The workshop will be held Friday september 5 (whole day) and Saturday September 6 (morning) at the Free University Amsterdam.

### *Costs* 

The workshop is free of charge and materials, location, lunch and dinner (friday evening) are provided for. Participants should pay themselves for eventual travel and hotelcosts.

### *Sponsors*

The workshop is kindly supported by the EU [FOSTER](http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) project.
