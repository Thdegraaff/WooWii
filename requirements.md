## Requirements

In order to follow this course on your own, you will need to have installed
some specific software on your computer. All the packages and libraries we
cover are free, open source and cross-platform, so you should not have much
trouble obtaining them.

* A terminal client:
    * __Windows__: one of the available options such as [Windows PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx)
    * __Mac__: default installed (under Apps/Utilities) or other flavors, such
      us [iTerm](http://iterm2.com)
    * __Linux__: plenty of options, including the default installed in each
      distribution (GNOME shell in Ubuntu, for example)

* [`git`](http://www.git-scm.com):
    * __Windows__: follow the official site [advice](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Windows) and install the executable from <http://msysgit.github.io>
    * __Mac__: installed by default
    * __Linux__: use the package manager of your distribution to install the
      package `git`

* A `LaTeX` distribution:
    * __Windows__
    * __Mac__
    * __Linux__

* `pandoc`. Two options, either directly or using the binary included in RStudio (see below). For direct downloads:
    * __Windows__
    * __Mac__
    * __Linux__


* `R`. Download the binary for your operating system from the [official
  R website](http://www.r-project.org). You can execute R code with the
  provided interpreter or, as we recommend, use the
  [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) interface (download it [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk)). 

* A modern browser, such as [Mozilla `Firefox`](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Google `Chrome`](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) or [`Safari`](http://www.apple.com/safari/).
