title: Version control & Automation
---

In this 2h. session we introduce the concepts of version control and
automation of tasks. The first relates to keeping track of changes as they
occur throughout the proccess, while the second one allows us to break up the
different components of an analysis and have them automatically run, when
needed, in the correct sequence. 

The two tools with which we will play to explore these ideas practically are
[`git`](http://www.git-scm.com) and [`make`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(Unix)). You will need to have them installed on  your machine to follow along in your laptop. Head over to the [Requirements](../requirements.html) page to see how to install them if you haven't yet.
