In this 2h. session we introduce the concept of markup languages in combination with pandoc and working with the terminal. In particular we focus on markdown: a very lightweight and markup language (and probably the fastest way to create slides). In particular we deal with:

1. `LaTeX`
2. `Markdown`
3. `Pandoc`

Although the last one, pandoc, is not completely necessary (it is under the hood of `RStudio`), we think it is important and handy enough to spend some on. 

### Requirements

For this session, we basically need three tools: `R`, `RStudio`, and `LaTeX`. Head over to the [Requirements](../requirements.html) page to see how to install them if you haven't yet. 

For the assignment we will replicate [this paper](../Assignments/OriginalPaper.pdf). 

### Outcomes

After this session you should:

* understand the basic command of the markdown language;
* be able to write a (part of a) paper in markdown in RStudio including:
	* headers;
	* links;
	* formula's;
	* tables, and
	* references;
* be able to export this to:
	* `HTML` export; 
	* `pdf` export;
	* Words' `docx` export.
