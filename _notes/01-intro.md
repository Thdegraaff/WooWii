title: Introduction
---

In this 3h. session we introduce the concepts of workflow, openness and reproducability. In the first part, We argue why they are important and what as social scientists we can learn from data scientists. OUr main argument is that, even though complete reproducability is often infeasible, we should strive for research to become *as reproducable* as possible.

In the second part we lay out the road-map for the rest of the workshop. Most importantly, we explain why in this workshop we make use a set of particular tools, namely: 

1. `R` and `RStudio` (with Yihui Xie's  `knitr` package)
2. Markdown language
3. `Bibdesk`/`Mendeley`
4. `Git` and `Github`
5. `GNU make`

We are aware that using a particular data analysis tool is costly in terms of time investment and is, in terms of preferences and needs, rather ideosyncratic. However, in this workshop we stick to one format and make use of the combination `R` and `RStudio` for two most reasons: (*i*) it works the best **out of the box** for our purposes and (*ii*) at the moment most researchers probably work with this combination for reproducability (at least it gets the biggest buzz...)

You will need to have them installed on  your machine to follow along in your laptop. Head over to the [Requirements](../requirements.html) page to see how to install them if you haven't yet.
