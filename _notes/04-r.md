title: Statistical analysis
---

In this 3h. session we take an overview of the main ideas behind making your
data analysis reproducible and transparent. For that, we use the `R`
statistical platform, likely the most popular choice among academia and
industry, as the main tool. 

We begin with the main ideas behind a reproducible approach to data analysis,
provide some background on the history of R and use a popular replication example to show
how to read, manipulate, interact, analyze, visualize and write your data. In
particular, we use the famous Reinhart and Rogoff replication exercise by
[Thomas Herndon et
al.](http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/)
