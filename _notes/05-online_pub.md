In this 1.5h session we introduce how you could make your reproducable research *open*. This basically means making use of repositories such as Github , which not only serves as a backup channel, but as well as a way of collabation with known and unknown authors. Further, we show that making slides in `RStudio` is breeze and why you actually might want to typeset a paper in `HTML` (answer: you make a webpage out of it using Github).

Concepts we review:

1. Open repositories (most notably: Github)
2. Creating HTML5 slides (and of course pdf slides) with just using Markdown and RStudio
3. Post your research as a webpage
