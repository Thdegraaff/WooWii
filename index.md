## Workshop On Open Workflows - 2nd. Edition 

### 5-6 Sept. 2014, Amsterdam, The Netherlands


**WooW-II** is a two-day workshop on open workflows for quantitative social scientists. Despite its recognized relevance, relative complexity and wide interest, virtually no training is provided on workflow design and choice of appropriate tools. Students and researchers in the social sciences receive no guidance as to why or how they should adopt habits that favor the open science principles in their research activity. In this workshop, we will cover the main ideas behind a well-designed workflow with openness, transparency and reproducibility in mind, *and* will provide an introductory, hands-on, overview of a set of free tools that have been designed with such values in mind.

The workshop is kindly supported by the EU [FOSTER](http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) project.
