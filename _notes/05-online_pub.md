In this 1.5h session we introduce how you could make your reproducable research *open*. This basically means making use of repositories such as Github, which not only serves as a backup repository, but as well as a way of collabation with known and unknown authors. Further, we show that making slides in `RStudio` is breeze and why you actually might want to typeset a paper in `HTML` (answer: you make a webpage out of it using Github).

Concepts we review:

1. Open repositories (most notably: Github)
2. Creating HTML5 slides (and of course pdf slides) with just using Markdown and RStudio
3. Post your research as a webpage

### Requirements

For this session, we basically need five tools: `R`, `RStudio`, the `git` and `github` packages and `LaTeX`. Head over to the [Requirements](../requirements.html) page to see how to install them if you haven't yet. 

For the assignment we will finalise replicating [this paper](../Assignments/OriginalPaper.pdf). The document for the assignment is [here](../Assignments/Assignment5/RepPaper.RMD) and the file with references is [here](../Assignments/Assignment5/bibliography.bib). The data can be found in this the `Assignments/Assignment5/Data/` folder and the `R` scripts needed to create the figures in the `Assignments/Assignment5/src/` folder to be downloaded from the [download](../download/) page.

The final document should look like [this](../Assignments/Final/RepPaper.pdf) and the whole paper including make file can be downloaded from the [download](../Download) page.

### Outcomes

After this session, you should be able to:

* mix code and text together (literate programming) in `RStudio`
* export this to:
	articles (in `html`, word `docx` or `pdf`)
	slides (in `html` or `pdf`)
* publish this to github's open repository
