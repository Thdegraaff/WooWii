WooW-II: Workshop On Open Workflows - 2nd. Edition
--------------------------------------------------

5-6 Sept. 2014, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

WooW-II is a two-day workshop on open workflows for quantitative social scientists. Despite its recognized relevance, relative complexity and wide interest, virtually no training is provided on workflow design and choice of appropriate tools. Students and researchers in the social sciences receive no guidance as to why or how they should adopt habits that favor the open science principles in their research activity. In this workshop, we will cover the main ideas behind a well-designed workflow with openness, transparency and reproducibility in mind, and will provide an introductory, hands-on, overview of a set of free tools that have been designed with such values in mind.

The workshop is free of charge. This includes materials, venue and meals. Travel and accomodation costs are not included and should be covered by the participants. Participants are also expected to bring their own laptop. 

If you would like to register, please send an email to Dani Arribas-Bel (d.arribas-bel@bham.ac.uk) or Thomas De Graaff (t.de.graaff@vu.nl) before August 1st.

Dani Arribas-Bel and Thomas de Graaff
