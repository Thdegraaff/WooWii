# Introduction

## Recap

Our main goal:

> To make our research as reproducable and visible as possible

This entails:

1. Sharing of code
2. Sharing of data (if possible and not proprietary nor privacy sensitive)
3. Sharing of output (presentation, article, website)

## The power of plain text

1.  Ubiquitous
2.  Usually small in size 
3.  Portable across platforms (and versions)
    + it will not be obsolote soon
    + everyone can read it everywhere
4.  It is scriptable (both as input as output)
    - code is almost **always** in text format
    - **usually** data is in text format as well
    - but underlying format for output (presentation, website, tables, articles, books) **can** be text as well

# Latex and friends

## Latex

1. What?
    + A set of macros around Tex, a markup language invented by Donald Knuth  
2. How?
    + Latex is a document preparation system and document markup language. [Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) 
3. Why?
    + Defacto standard in academic publishing
    + Formulae used in html pages (e.g., Wikipedia)
    + Macro's thus scriptable (whoohoo)
4. But...
    + Notation a bit cumbersome
    + For small texts a bit too much and not geared for HTML [(see also)](http://yihui.name/en/2013/10/markdown-or-latex/)

## A minimal example

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\section{My Paper}
I just discovered that:
\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}
\end{document}
```

## Bibtex

+ Basically a free reference manager (actually more a style of managing references)
+ Very versatile and very powerful (most other markup languages work with bibtex as well)
+ Free managers, such as bibdesk or mendeley, are now ubiquitous

# Markdown

## Why markdown?

1. Easy to learn [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2. Much less notation than Latex . In general
    + Latex is for paper (aka dead trees)
    + Markdown is for HTML (blogs, wikipedia and so)
    + but sneakily uses some Latex when needed
3. Focus on text
4. Can be ``easily'' changed in html or pdf (via Latex)---even in Word if needed
5. Can be extended with code or---much better---its results

## Language syntax 

Emphasis:
```markdown
*italic* **bold**
_italic_ __bold__
```

Headers:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Unordened lists
```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
```

Ordered List
```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Images:

```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Code blocks:

```markdown
  ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
  ```
```

which renders as:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

To embed mathematics just use Latex  notation:

```Latex
$$e=mc^2$$
```

which surprisingly looks as excel type of formulae and renders as:

$$e=mc^2$$

# Pandoc

## The swiss knife of formats

So how do we glue everything together and produce wonderful html and pdf out of thin air? With **[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)**

+ Pandoc can convert from (not extensive):
    + markdown (whoohoo), Latex, HTML, DocBook, Org-mode, and ... Words docx 
+ To (and here we go...)
    + HTML formats (including those very cool and nerdy HTML(5) slides)
    + via Latex to pdf
    + Word (but support somewhat limited) and OpenOffice formats
    + various markup formats
    + and much more

# The terminal

## The terminal

+ What?
    + Unix kind of application that is completely working without GUI's and governing all processes...(btw, powershell for Windows works now really well as well)
+ Do we really need it?
    + not really, but it makes you faster, more versatile, nerdier, and you have to know what you are doing. 
    + and there are some applications that only work in the terminal (such as make and pandoc) 
+ So, why is it so cool again?
    + you can make everything **scriptable**
