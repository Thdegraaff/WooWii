## Requirements

In order to follow this course on your own, you will need to have installed
some specific software on your computer. All the packages and libraries we
cover are free, open source and cross-platform, so you should not have much
trouble obtaining them.

* A terminal client:
    * __Windows__: one of the available options such as [Windows PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx)
    * __Mac__: default installed (under Apps/Utilities) or other flavors, such
      us [iTerm](http://iterm2.com)
    * __Linux__: plenty of options, including the default installed in each
      distribution (GNOME shell in Ubuntu, for example)
      
* Command line tools:
    * __Windows__ [`rtools`](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) Give you some needed command line functionality
    * __Mac__  `command line developer tools` how to download explained [here](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html). Try to avoid downloading XCode (very large)
    * __Linux__ Already pre-installed

* [`git`](http://www.git-scm.com):
    * __Windows__: follow the official site [advice](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Windows) and install the executable from <http://msysgit.github.io>
    * __Mac__: installed by default
    * __Linux__: use the package manager of your distribution to install the
      package `git`

* A `LaTeX` distribution:
    * __Windows__ [`Miktex`](http://miktex.org/) The most used `Latex` distribution for windows
    * __Mac__ [`MacTex` package](https://tug.org/mactex/) Most complete distribution for OsX
    * __Linux__ Most likely pre-installed

* `pandoc`. Two options, either directly or using the binary included in RStudio (see below). For direct downloads:
    * __Windows__ [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)
    * __Mac__ [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)
    * __Linux__ [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)


* `R`. Download the binary for your operating system from the [official
  R website](http://www.r-project.org). You can execute R code with the
  provided interpreter or, as we recommend (and __use__), use the
  [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) interface (download it [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk)). 

* A modern browser, such as [Mozilla `Firefox`](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Google `Chrome`](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) or [`Safari`](http://www.apple.com/safari/).
