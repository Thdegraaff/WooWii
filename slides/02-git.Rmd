# Version control

## Version control - *What* (not)

!["Piled Higher and Deeper", by Jorge Cham. http://www.phdcomics.com](fig/phdcomic.png)

## Version control *What*

*The modern scientist's lab notebook*

* Keep track of changes in a project *as the occur*
* Document the changes
* Archive the history in a way that allows to easily roll back 
* Tell differences with other versions (collaboration) and be able to merge
  them

## *Version control Why*

* **Sanity**: nothing "committed" is lost
* **Archival**: keep record on when what changed how
* **Collaboration**: work simultaneously with colleagues, properly merge and manage conflicts

Very [neat video](http://flowingdata.com/2012/11/30/time-lapse-writing-of-a-research-paper/) exemplifying the concept

## `git`

Today:

* Set up a new project
* Track changes as you work
* Examine the change history
* Compare different versions
* Restore old versions of a file
* Other tricks to better manage your `git` project

Not today (but you should check it out):

* [Collaboration](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/02-collab.html) with `git`
* [Conflicts](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/03-conflict.html) in `git`

## `git` - Requirements & Setup

Assuming you have `git` installed:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your@email.org"
```

These are for attribution purposes only, it does not sign you up for any
service

Additionally, you may want to set up a default editor (make sure you actually
have it installed):

```
git config --global core.editor "vim" 
```

Additional trick:

```
$ git config --global --add color.ui true
```

## `git` - New project (repository)

Navigate to the folder where you want to create the new project and create the
directory, naming it the way you prefer:

```
$ cd /path/to/folder
$ mkdir my_new_folder
$ cd my_new_folder
```

Then start tracking:

```
$ git init
```

## `git` - New project (repository) (cnt.)

This will create a hidden folder called `.git`, which will story all the
history (although you will never access it directly).

A very common command you will use repeatedly is `status`:

```
$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## `git` - Work...

Start, for example, with one text file. You can create it from the text editor
of your preference, or you can create it using a command line editor, such as
`vim`:

```
$ vim nobelp_paper.txt
```

And start working:

```
The world is flat.
```

## `git` - Work... (cnt.)

Take a break. Save and quit the file. And now check the status of the `git`
project:

```
$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	nobelp_paper.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## `git` - ... and track your work!

At this point, you want `nobelp_paper.txt` to be tracked as you work on it.
This does *not* come automatically (like in Dropbox, for example), but you
need to explicitly add the file:

```
$ git add nobelp_paper.txt
```

Now `git` knows it has to keep an eye on the file:

## `git` - ... and track your work! (cnt.)

```
$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   nobelp_paper.txt
#
```

To record the file at a given stage, you need to "commit" the changes. Include
a (short) message describing the advancement:

```
$ git commit -m "Current state of knowledge about Earth"
```

Everything is properly recorded at this point.

## `git` - Why `add` and `commit`?

![Local spaces](fig/git-staging-area.png)

(Source: [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/img/git-staging-area.png))

## `git` - Why `add` and `commit`? (cnt.)

```
$ git status

# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

It means you could keep working, not add, and, when you commit, only the added
version will be tracked. Very useful when a project has **many files**!

## `git` - Work, track, work, track...

```
$ vim nobelp_paper.txt
```

```
The world is NOT flat.
```

```
$ git status

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   nobelp_paper.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## `git` - Work, track, work, track... (cnt.)

Since the file is under tracking already, you can `add` and `commit` in a
single shot:

```
$ git commit -am "Correcting view about Earth"

[master a643fa0] Correcting view about Earth
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Repeat this process as many times as snapshots you want to record of your
project.

## `git` - Examine log

```
$ git log

commit a643fa0ca03291793cb432d799defd0f496b5c9a
Author: Dani Arribas-Bel <daniel.arribas.bel@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 28 10:50:01 2014 -0500

    Correcting view about Earth

commit 6d119ff4a319650bfef06d279b000a56f5fe7759
Author: Dani Arribas-Bel <daniel.arribas.bel@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 28 10:36:36 2014 -0500

    Current state of knowledge about Earth
```

## `git` - Examine log (cnt.)

Or a more compressed view...

```
$ git log --pretty=oneline

a643fa0ca03291793cb432d799defd0f496b5c9a Correcting view about Earth
6d119ff4a319650bfef06d279b000a56f5fe7759 Current state of knowledge about Earth
```

Or more detailed:

```
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %a, %ar : %s"

a643fa0 - %a, 17 minutes ago : Correcting view about Earth
6d119ff - %a, 30 minutes ago : Current state of knowledge about Earth
```

See more details about tweaking `git log` in [this link](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).

## `git` - Compare versions

Current version from last one tracked (`HEAD`):

```
$ vim nobelp_paper.txt
```

```
The world is NOT flat at all.
```

```
$ git diff

diff --git a/nobelp_paper.txt b/nobelp_paper.txt
index 5a35641..3215244 100644
--- a/nobelp_paper.txt
+++ b/nobelp_paper.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-The world is NOT flat.
+The world is NOT flat at all.
```

## `git` - Compare versions (cnt.)

You can go back in time n revisions (`HEAD~n`):

```
$ git commit -am "Reaffirming myself about Earth's non-flatness"
```

```
$ git diff HEAD~2 nobelp_paper.txt

diff --git a/nobelp_paper.txt b/nobelp_paper.txt
index 3fa4573..3215244 100644
--- a/nobelp_paper.txt
+++ b/nobelp_paper.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-The world is flat.
+The world is NOT flat at all.
```

## `git` - Compare versions (ctd.)

Or compare with a specific revision (check log for that):

```
$ git diff 6d119ff nobelp_paper.txt

diff --git a/nobelp_paper.txt b/nobelp_paper.txt
index 3fa4573..3215244 100644
--- a/nobelp_paper.txt
+++ b/nobelp_paper.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-The world is flat.
+The world is NOT flat at all.
```

## `git` - Compare versions (cnt.)

Or compare two previous versions:

```
$ git diff 6d119ff a643fa0 nobelp_paper.txt

diff --git a/nobelp_paper.txt b/nobelp_paper.txt
index 3fa4573..5a35641 100644
--- a/nobelp_paper.txt
+++ b/nobelp_paper.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-The world is flat.
+The world is NOT flat.
```

## `git` - Restore older version

Suppose we delete the file by accident:

```
$ rm nobelp_paper.txt
```

Bringing the last version back is straightforward:

```
$ git checkout HEAD nobelp_paper.txt
```

Also works if you decide to go back to a previous version of the file:

```
$ git checkout HEAD~2 nobelp_paper.txt
```

## `git` - Restore older version (cnt.)

These modifications act as if you had edited the file:

```
$ git status

On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   nobelp_paper.txt

```

So if you want to save the project at that stage again, commit:

```
$ git commit -am "Going back to original ideas"
```

## `git` - Several files

* `git` tracks "**snapshots**" of the project, rather than changes in particular
files.
* Extending this process to several files in the project is straightforward
* The previous workflow favors keeping things organized in **different
files**. Although you can manage everything in one master file, having the
sections of a paper split into different files makes going back and forth 
in time much easier and flexible.

## Exercise

* Create a new file with some text and include in the tracking.
* Make a change in the file and commit it.
* Bring the project to a state where `nobelp_paper.txt` is in the initial
  version and the new file is at the latest.

## Exercise (suggested) result

```
$ vim corollary.txt
```

```
I am not really sure about Earth's flatness.
```

```
$ git add corollary.txt
$ git commit -am "Adding corollary"
```

```
$ vim corollary.txt
```

```
I am not really sure about Earth's flatness, it depends.
```

```
$ git commit -am "Introducing uncertainty to corollary"
```
## Exercise (suggested) result (cnt.)
```
$ git log --pretty=oneline nobelp_paper.txt

$ git checkout 6d119ff4a319650bfef06d279b000a56f5fe7759 nobelp_paper.txt
$ git commit -am "Completing exercise"
```

## `git` - Get selective on a project

* A project might have several files (we've seen how to deal with that)
* Some of those you might prefer to exclude (or not care to include)
* By default they will not be tracked
* You can create a `.gitignore` file in the root folder listing files to be
  explicitly excluded from tracking

```
$ vim .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Adding ignore file"
```
## `git` - Get selective on a project (cnt.)

```
*.aux
```

```
$ vim something.aux
```

```
$ git status

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

# Task automation

# Task automation 

*A button to push and reproduce*

## *What*

* It is important to keep things **modular**, **flexible** and **separate**, 
  as long as it's possible
* That also implies as a project grows larger and more complex, managing it
  and keep it easily reproducible becomes harder and more involved
* **Task automation** is based on the idea that some of the steps needed to
  reproduce and output can be programmed (or scripted)
* A sequence of all the steps and order, much like a cooking recipe, can be
  encapsulated in a file that can be re-run

## *Why*

* **Efficiency**: avoid doing manually the same thing over and over
* **Correctness**: less prone to errors
* **Big picture design**: Forces to always keep in mind the overall structure of the project 

# `make`

*The recipe builder*

* Very old (stable) piece of free software
* Still used today
* Designed to make possible to compile complicated code projects
* *Glue* of the Unix mantra: "do one thing, and do it very well".

Understanding a research project (e.g. paper) as a code project: 
to obtain certain outcomes (e.g. final paper version), one needs to
complete a series of steps in a particular order (clean data, run regressions,
write paper).

Benefits:

* Rewards more modular work
* Forces you to make very explicit the chain of events that your project/paper
  needs to be created
* Allows to easily re-run as many times as neccesary (parts of) your paper
  without any manual checks

# The simplest intro to `make`

Just as a "chainer" of files:

```
$ vim Makefile
```

```bash
all:
    write_my_diss
    pdflatex dissertation.tex
    R CMD BATCH a_little_luck.R
```

Running `make` will execute all of the three processes.

Suppose you want to have a handy shortcut for the first two only:

```bash
all:
    write_my_diss
    pdflatex dissertation.tex
    R CMD BATCH a_little_luck.R

hardwork:
    pdflatex dissertation.tex
    R CMD BATCH a_little_luck.R
```

Running `make` will still execute all of them, but running `make hardwork`
will only run the first two.

# The `make` model

* **Targets**: output created from a process. 
* **Sources**: programs/commands that produce a target

For example:

```bash
dissertation.tex:write_my_diss
    write_my_diss
```

You can chain steps and add more sources for a target:

```bash
dissertation.tex: write_my_diss
    write_my_diss

phd.txt: dissertation.tex a_little_luck.R
    R CMD BATCH a_little_luck.R
```

If `phd.txt` does not exist, or `dissertation.tex` and/or
`a_little_luck.R` have changed since last time it was produced, `make`
will run the R process again, which should produce a new version of `phd.txt`
