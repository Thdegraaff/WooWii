title: Statistical analysis
---

In this 3h. session we take an overview of the main ideas behind making your
data analysis reproducible and transparent. For that, we use the `R`
statistical platform, likely the most popular choice among academia and
industry, as the main tool. 

We begin with the main ideas behind a reproducible approach to data analysis,
provide some background on the history of R and use a popular replication example to show
how to read, manipulate, interact, analyze, visualize and write your data. In
particular, we use the famous Reinhart and Rogoff replication exercise by
[Thomas Herndon et
al.](http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/)

### Requirements

To follow on this session on your own machine, you will need both `R` and
`RStudio` installed. For links to download and install them, head over to
the [Requirements](../requirements.html) page to see how to install them if 
you haven't yet.

No previous background on `R` or any specific statistical background is needed
for this session, although some basic understanding of statistics and data (at an
undergraduate level) is required to comfortably follow along.

### Outcomes

After completing the session, you should be able to:

* Have an understanding of what reproducible statistical analysis is and why
  it is very important to adopt a version of it in your own research
* Know what `R` is, how it was created and what are its main strengths
* Find and install `R` packages and learn to use them through different ways
  of accessing help and support for them
* Read and write data in `R` using several formats
* Explore a dataset in `R`
* Manipulate a dataset, applying transformations and performing queries to the
  dataset
* Perform a basic statistical analysis in `R`, including calculating descriptive measures and running a regression
* Visualize a dataset
* Export the output of an analysis in several formats, including LaTeX.
