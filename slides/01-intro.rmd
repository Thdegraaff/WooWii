# Introduction

## *Why* this workshop?

- In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why they make sense)

- Increasing *need* for/in openness & transparancy

    - from journals, universities and governments
    - increase in cooperation (over wider distances)
    - access to your own files
    - make yourself more visible 

- Why *we* want to give this workshop

    - implementation of an earlier overview workshop
    - our goal is to give these kinds of workshops on large conferences

## What we want (and don't want) with this workshop 

- We are mostly interested in the principles behind a good open (scientific) workflow, aware of the facts that

    - there is no final, optimal, set of workflow tools
    - investment is very, very costly

- However, being a practical workshop we do

    - work with a specific set of tools (R, markdown, pandoc, git) which
    - enables us *in this workshop* to  make a paper reproducable and open
    
## Related work 

- Inspired by Kieran Healey's (associate professor in sociology) work: [Choosing your Workflow Applications](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf)

- Courses for reproducable research seems to pop up everywhere (but mostly in datascience courses):

# Workflow 

## Open?

* Workflow: 
  *Progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value to the organization's activities* ([BusinessDictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/workflow.html))

* Open workflow: One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

## Research cycle

![Research cycle](fig/ResearchCycle.pdf)

## Why bother about a workflow or tools?

- Good scientific practice: *document how you have achieved your results*; this ensures

    - Reproducibility 
    - Transparency
    - Modularity
    - Portability (across systems and users)
    - Efficiency
    - Self-sanity

## Why should it be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Transparency
* Modularity
* Portability (across systems and users)
* Efficiency
* Visibility

## When should I adopt an open reproducable workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time 

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step*

# Reproducability

## In computation science:

> The data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding (Peng, 2011)

- Literature programming (Donald E. Knuth, 1984):

    - weaving of **code**, **documentation** and **output** (articles, presentations, websites) 

## In the social sciences?

- Complete reproducability often not feasible
    - qualitative research
    - propietary data (?)
- but you can come a long way, especially with
    - theoretical work
    - quantitative (e.g., statistical or simulation) work

- Goal should be more to make your research as reproducable *as possible*

## Code, documentation and output

1. Synonyms

2. All based on text files

3. Encompasses almost anything
    - data itself
    - set of commands for data cleaning and statistical analysis
    - database with references 
    - transcript of interviews
    - text for aticles, presentations or websites
    
4. Only output is displayed/interpreted differently (e.g., in a browser or pdf viewer)

## Our goal (not being ambitious)

What we want is that with *one single* command we

- read in and transform our data
- run the analysis
- create output (tables and figures)
- combine output with text and references
- create presentation material (paper, slides, webpages) and
- publish presentation material on an open repository

This all under a full fledged versioning control system 

## Tools for reproducability

- Markup lanaguages
    - Markdown
    - LaTeX 
    - HTML
    
- Terminal tools (GNU make, diff, pandoc)
    
- Versioning system (Git & VCN)

- Reference manager (bibdesk/Mendeley)

## Tools for reproducability (cnt.)

- Statistical software (pure command line driven): Python and R 

- Environments
    - [R](http://www.rproject.org/) and [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) environment
    - Python and [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) environment
    - Python and [Sumatra](http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra)
    - Emacs [org mode](http://orgmode.org/) 
    
## Tools for openness

- Repositories:
    - Github (host webpages as well)
    - Bitbucket

- R packages [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)

- iPython notebook viewer [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)

## What we use in this workshop

1. R and RStudio (with the `knitr` package)
2. Markdown language
3. Bibdesk/Mendeley
4. Git and Github
5. GNU make

Only implicitly we make use of LaTeX, BibTex, HTML and pandoc (all under the hood of RStudio)
